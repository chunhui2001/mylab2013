      Building the next big thing on the web?  It is never a good idea to serve your static files, i.e. style sheets, javascripts and images, from your main application server.  This task should be offloaded to another server for three reasons -
<br />
<br />
      It ties up resources in your app server while it would be performing other tasks.
      App servers are hardly ever optimized for simple file serving.
      Browsers can fetch resources in parallel from the two servers.  This can improve the load time significantly.
<br />
<br />
      Most major websites on the web such as Facebook, Best Buy et.al use this concept.  Some opt to use commercial services called Content Delivery Networks (CDN) to accomplish this task.  Two such companies are Akamai and Limelight.  You can see this for yourself by checking the source of images on Best Buyâ€™s site, for instance.  Images have the URL:
<br />
<br />
      http://www.bestbuyon.com/sites/default/files/COD_MW3_300x145.jpg
<br />
<br />
      If you look up the domain bestbuyon.com, you will see that it is actually being served by multiple Akamai servers.

These CDN services can be fairly expensive and may be out of scope of a startup budget, or if you are doing a side project.  In my past experience, starting price was around $700/mo.   The good news is that you can create a less ambitious version of a CDN yourself using free, open-source tools.  The set up which I describe below can handle boat-loads of traffic.  If you start outgrowing this, then you already have a successful website and should be earning enough to pay for a CDN!

      <div>I have found over the years that it is always best to upload original images and resize them on the fly as needed.  This can be useful in multiple scanarios:</div>
