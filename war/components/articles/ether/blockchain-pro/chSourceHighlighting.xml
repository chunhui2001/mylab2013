Truffle, the development framework, is certainly one of the best Ethereum Development tools for developing and deploying Ethereum applications. In layman language, you could create projects, code and compile smart contracts, run automated tests, migrate, and interact with the contract. So, Truffle is offering a complete ecosystem for your dApp development efforts.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
One of the more appealing features of Truffle is that it can perform the automated tests both in JavaScript and Solidity. This could help you tremendously if you excel in JavaScript. Plus, Truffle supports both Mocha and Chai test frameworks.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
The deployment efforts need your smart contracts to connect to a blockchain network. Truffle offers a personal blockchain that you could store on your local device that doesn’t interact with the Ethereum network. This feature gives you headroom to tweak your projects as per your needs. Furthermore, it acknowledges that your contracts may update or evolve over time and accepts manageable deployment and migration scripts.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
As you can see, Truffle is a robust development framework that considers all sorts of practical deployment scenarios and issues. All of these features surely save an Ethereum developer from a plethora of troubles.

<div>
MetaMask has gained much traction among the common users over the last few years. Simplicity and convenience are the two pillars that made it one of the most popular Ethereum development tools.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Essentially, MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet and a blockchain application gateway that functions as a web browser extension (it also has a mobile app). So, everyone can add this handy little extension on their computer or mobile browsers, including — Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave, and others.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
MetaMask offers key vault, login security, token wallet, and exchange facilities — all in one package. Moreover, users can browse and connect with the blockchain applications without jeopardizing their security and privacy.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
How is this user-centric tool bring value to the Ethereum developers? Due to the simplistic nature of this app, MetaMask has become the go-to token wallet for both veterans and newcomers. Ethereum developers can showcase their applications to a large audience through MetaMask support. So, if you’re an Ethereum developer aiming to increase user interaction for your distributed app, you need to consider adding MetaMask to your development efforts.

    <c:sourceContent type="html" title="Ganache – Personal Blockchain With A Robust Command-Line Tool" id="sourceContent1"
                     titleStyle="padding-left:0;color:green;font-size:1em;background-color:white;font-size:1.6em;margin-top:1em;"
                     bodyStyle="background-color:white;padding:0;font-size:1.2em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:monospace;">
      <![CDATA[
<div>
When it comes to Ethereum dApp testing, very few top Ethereum development tools come even close to the functionality of Ganache. Ganache gives you a personal blockchain to run on your local device that you can use throughout the development cycle.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
It helps to develop, test, and deploy your Ethereum smart contracts in a safer environment. So, you can tweak or troubleshoot any issue without connecting to any public testnet or mainnet.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Ganache has two components — Ganache UI and Ganache CLI. Ganache CLI is the command-line tool that you’d be using for Ethereum development. This CLI was previously known as TestRPC. TruffleSuite later acquired TestRPC and gave it a new name — Ganache CLI. How does Ganache CLI work and what does it do?
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
The command line incorporates ethereumjs for client behavior simulation with all kinds of RPC functionalities. Developers can develop and test their codes to determine what is working and what is not.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Ganache UI, on the other hand, serves as the visual interface for the CLI. You could think of it as the built-in block explorer giving you insight and analytics of the internal blockchain.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
As writing codes on Ethereum blockchain (mainnet) requires Ether, you should test your dApp in a personal or internal blockchain first for tweaking and troubleshooting. This is why Ganache is one of the most popular Ethereum development tools.

      <![CDATA[
<div>
If you’re looking for a solid compiling and debugging tool for smart contract development, Remix IDE is one of the best Ethereum Development tools for you. Essentially, Remix IDE is an open-source JavaScript-based compiler that lets you code directly from your web browser. Of course, it has a separate desktop application also.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Unlike many other Ethereum development tools, Remix takes a direct approach, maybe a bit too direct! Their website directly lands you in the compiler. That’s why many users, especially new developers, complain about the user-friendliness of the website.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
However, remix outshines others with its rich collection of plug-ins and libraries. Remix Project address these utility tools as — Remix Plugin Engine and Remix Libs, respectively. Another noteworthy feature of Remix IDE is that it debugs your code in real-time while you’re writing them.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
The straightforward approach for developing smart contracts in Solidity from the browser makes Remix one of the top Ethereum development tools.

    <c:sourceContent type="html" title="Geth – Ethereum CLI Client Based on Go" id="sourceContent1"
                     titleStyle="padding-left:0;color:green;font-size:1em;background-color:white;font-size:1.6em;margin-top:1em;"
                     bodyStyle="background-color:white;padding:0;font-size:1.2em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:monospace;">
      <![CDATA[
<div>
Geth is by far one of the best Ethereum development tools that is a CLI client to implement Go Ethereum as the blockchain protocol. Basically, it is a command-line interface that can run as a full node, archive node, or light node. Geth serves as a wallet to store Ether, make transactions, deploy smart contracts — anything that Mist (deprecated) could do.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
But Geth became a superior option compared to Mist, as it can also mine Ether and serve as a gateway to the Ethereum network through JSON RPC endpoints over HTTP.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
These two additional features are extremely lucrative to the developers and caused the obsoletion of Mist. There is another strong reason behind the popularity of Geth — developers want to interact with the Ethereum mainnet and Geth serves that purpose perfectly.

    <c:sourceContent type="html" title="Parity – A Rust-based Ethereum Client" id="sourceContent1"
                     titleStyle="padding-left:0;color:green;font-size:1em;background-color:white;font-size:1.6em;margin-top:1em;"
                     bodyStyle="background-color:white;padding:0;font-size:1.2em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:monospace;">
      <![CDATA[
<div>
Just like Geth, Parity is one of the most popular Ethereum development tools and both of these tools serve the same purposes — an Ethereum client. The main difference between Geth and Parity is that Parity is written in Rust. While it’s hard to compare Go and Rust, as they both are remarkable languages, Rust is a bit ahead due to its memory management and higher performance. So, Parity is inherently faster than Geth (slightly).
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Parity incorporates three core technologies — Polkadot, Substrate, and Parity Signer. Substrate is the blockchain development framework that uses WebAssembly runtime architecture and Libp2p networking. Substrate uses Rust for primary implementation and JavaScript for secondary implementation. So, you’ll be getting speed, reliability, and developability — all in one package.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Polkadot, the second pillar of Parity is the cross-blockchain communication client. You can even transfer data from a public blockchain to a private one — offering a true multi-chain environment. The unique feature of Polkadot is that you can even transfer arbitrary data, apart from tokens, across blockchains. Due to the superior interoperability, you’ll get improved economic and transactional scalability to help you scale Ethereum dApps.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
The third pillar of Parity is the Parity Signer. This is an offline wallet that you can use on your mobile.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
However, most developers using Parity only to the veteran developers as Parity is a bit complicated compared to Go. Plus, the installation process is a hassle. In simpler terms, stick with Geth if you’re a newcomer in the development world and use Parity if you think you’re competent enough.

      <![CDATA[
<div>
Ethers.js is one of the most complete and compact Ethereum library ecosystem, making it one of the most popular Ethereum development tools. Initially, ethers.js was designed for ethers.io — a wallet and dApp browser. But with time, the library has expanded extensively and now used as a general-purpose Ethereum library.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Previously, web3.js was the number one Ethereum library but ethers.js has surpassed it with the rich features and usability. It works perfectly with the popular JSON wallets, such as — Geth, Parity, and Crowdsale. And able to connect to common Ethereum nodes, such as — MetaMask, Infura API, JSON-RPC, Alchemy, or Etherscan.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
However, the tiny 104kb size and the completeness make ethers.js the best-in-class library ecosystem. It also has an MIT license for including all dependencies.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
One of the strongest features of ethers.js is that allows you to export and import BIP 39 mnemonic phrases and HD wallets. Also, ethers.js is always updating the test cases collections. This library is fully TypeScript ready that definition files and complete TypeScript sources.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
In short, ethers.js is one of the best Ethereum development tools that you must need for your development efforts.

<div>
Coming from Consensys, Infura is an API access for Ethereum and IPFS networks. As you know, any application that is connected to a server, uses an API working as an intermediary between the application and the server. As we are essentially using Web 3.0 with Ethereum applications, we need a new breed of APIs.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Among all the Ethereum APIs out there, web3.js and Infura API are two of the best options. But Infura beats web3.js in several decision-making criteria. It supports JSON-RPC over HTTPS and WebSocket with instant access.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
This means you’ll not have to spend your precious time building an infrastructure from the ground up. That’s why many refer to Infura as an Infrastructure-as-a-service. About 60% of all Ethereum apps use Infura API, including — Coinbase Wallet, CryptoKitties, MetaMask, and Compound.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
One of the strongest features of Infura API is the access to an insightful dashboard. The dashboard is full of graphical analytics, such as — bandwidth usage, top method calls, etc.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
If you’re worried about the cost, there’s good news — Infura offers a free account too with the access to Ethereum mainnet and testnets. However, this free account is limited to 100,000 requests/day and up to 3 projects. You need to go for monthly premium subscriptions for better support.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
So, if you need an API, Infura is one of the best Ethereum development tools.

Embark is another great Ethereum development framework and one of the best Ethereum development tools. It integrates with Ethereum blockchains (EVM), decentralized storage systems (IPFS), and communication platforms. Embark uses Swarm for deployment.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
With Embark, you can automatically deploy contracts to a testnet, private net, or the mainnet. Embark keeps track of your contracts and automatically redeploys the contracts and dApps as per your changes. And the best part is that’s you can develop contracts with JavaScript.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
For decentralized storage, it uses IPFS or Swarm. You can deploy the full application to these two storage systems. It uses EmbarkJS to upload, store, and retrieve data on dApp.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Another great feature of Embark is its modularity. You can either develop individual smart contracts or go for building a full-fledged dApp. Integration and extension processes are quite simple as it has a wide collection of plug-ins. Solc, Solium, Etherscan, Remix, Snark — are among the popular plug-ins for Embark.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Then, there is Cockpit — Embark’s web interface for developing, debugging, and deploying dApps. You’ll get a Web UI dashboard, explorer, and a code editor.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Overall, Embark is one of the best Ethereum development tools out there for being a flexible development framework with a rich plug-in collection.

Drizzle is the third and the final tool in the TruffleSuite. Truffle and Ganache are mainly used for development and testing, respectively. Drizzle offers a collection of front-end libraries — completing the overall development needs with TruffleSuite. This front-end support makes dApp development way more convenient and predictable.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
At the heart of this Ethereum dev tool, lies a reactive Ethereum datastore (Redux). This Redux datastore gives you access to more development tools. Plus, Drizzle synchronizes contract data and transaction data.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Another notable thing about Drizzle is that the tool is fully modular. The two packages are — Drizzle and Drizzle-React. Drizzle is the basic package between the two options — serves as a core library. Then, there is Drizzle-React — which connects Drizzle with your existing React applications through DrizzleProvider and drizzleConnect.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.325em;">
Drizzle should be on your Ethereum tools list as it one of the few tools to help you with the front-end development efforts.

Truffle 大多数命令都是在 Truffle 项目目录下运行的。 所以第一步是创建一个 Truffle 项目。 可以创建一个空项目模板，不过对于刚接触 Truffle 的同学，推荐使用 Truffle Boxes，它提供了示例应用代码和项目模板。 我们将使用 MetaCoin box 作为案例，它创建一个可以在帐户之间转移的 Token（代币）。
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
  &#x278A; 安装 Truffle
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.625em;">

除了用上面的 Truffle Develop，还可以选择使用 Ganache, 这是一个桌面应用，他同样会创建一个个人模拟的区块链。 对于刚接触以太坊的同学来说，Ganache 会更容易理解，因为他把所有的信息，都输在前端的界面。
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
不像 Truffle Develop 把链和控制台集成在一起，使用 Ganache 需要编辑配置文件，以便 Truffle 能链接 Ganache 实例。
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
1. 下载安装 <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a>.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
2. 编辑器打开 truffle.js ，使用下面的内容：
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
module.exports = {

      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    }
  }
};
</pre>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
这是使用默认的连接参数去连接 Ganache（如果IP和端口有变化，需要同步修改上面的内容）。
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
3. 保存关闭配置文件。

<div>
可以使用控制台 console 和合约进行交互：
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
我们在例子中使用 web3.eth.getAccounts() , 它返回一个 promise 从中可以获取到由助记词生成的所有账号。 如果指定 (await web3.eth.getAccounts())[0] 会返回 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57.
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
在 Truffle v5, 控制台支持 async/await 方法（同步方式）, 这样让跟合约交互更简单了，方法如下：
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
1. 获取部署合约实例及获取账号列表：
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
truffle(development)> let instance = await MetaCoin.deployed()
truffle(development)> let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
</pre>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
2. 检查账号余额：
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
truffle(development)> let balance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
truffle(development)> balance.toNumber()
</pre>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
3. 查看以太价值（其实就是调用了一个合约方法：合约方法里定义了一个metacoin 价值 2 ether)：
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
truffle(development)> let ether = await instance.getBalanceInEth(accounts[0])
truffle(development)> ether.toNumber()
</pre>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
3. 发送一些 metacoin 到其他的账号 :
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
truffle(development)> instance.sendCoin(accounts[1], 500)
</pre>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
4. 检查刚刚收款人的余额：
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
truffle(development)> let received = await instance.getBalance(accounts[1])
truffle(development)> received.toNumber()
</pre>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
5. 检查刚刚发送方的余额：
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
truffle(development)> let newBalance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])

调试区块链上的交易与调试传统应用程序（例如，用C++或Javascript编写的应用程序）不同。在区块链上调试交易时，没有实时运行代码; 相反，我们将逐步执行该交易的历史执行，并将该执行映射到其关联的代码上。这为调试提供了许多自由，因此我们可以随时调试任何交易，只要我们拥有交易与之交互的合约的代码和工件(artifacts)即可。可以将这些代码和工件（artifacts）类似于传统调试器所需的调试符号。
</div>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
要调试交易，需要以下几个条件：
</div>
<ul style="margin-top:.325em;list-style: disc;margin-left: 1.5em;">
  <li>Truffle 4.0 及以上；</li>
  <li>所要调试区块链上的交易哈希值；</li>
  <li>交易对应的合约源代码和工件(artifacts)。</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
注意，只要存在于链上交易，我们都可以调试它，即使交易发生异常或者gas耗尽，也没关系。

<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
$ truffle debug
</pre>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
无论哪种方式启动的调试器，一旦它开始运行了，它就不仅限于调试启动时附加的交易（号）; 可以卸载当前交易并加载新交易，如下所述。

<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
启动调试器后，打开的交互界面和其他类型应用程序调试器差不多。在它启动时，将看到以下内容：
</div>
<ul style="margin-top:.325em;list-style: disc;margin-left: 1.5em;">
  <li>在此交易过程中处理或创建的地址列表。</li>
  <li>调试器所支持的调试命令列表。</li>
  <li>以及交易的初始入口点，包括合约源文件和代码预览。</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-top:.625em;">
<b>enter</b> 回车键设置为执行最后输入的命令。当调试器启动时，在执行期间 <b>enter</b> 键被设置为步进到源代码的下一个逻辑元素（即，由以太坊虚拟机确定的下一个表达式或语句）。此时，我们可以按 <b>enter</b> 单步执行交易，或者输入一个可用命令来更详细地分析交易。下面是命令列表详述。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (o) 跳过（step over）</h2>
<div>
此命令跳过当前行（即当前在 Solidity 源文件中语句或表达式的位置），如果我们不想在当前行上进入函数调用或合约创建，或者我们想快速跳转到源文件中的特定点，请使用此命令。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (i) 进入（step into）</h2>
<div>
此命令进入当前所在的函数调用或合约创建。使用此命令跳转到该函数内，并快速开始调试其中存在的代码。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (u) 跳出（step out）</h2>
<div>
此命令退出当前运行的函数。如果这是交易的入口点，使用此命令会快速返回到调用函数，或结束交易的执行。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (n) 下一步（step next）</h2>
<div>
此命令将执行源代码中的下一个逻辑语句或表达式。例如，在虚拟机可以评估完整表达式之前，需要首先评估子表达式。 如果要分析虚拟机评估的每个逻辑项，请使用此命令。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (;) 单步指令（step instruction）</h2>
<div>
此命令允许我们逐步执行虚拟机评估的每个单独指令。如果要了解 Solidity 源代码创建的低级字节码，这个命令非常有用。使用此命令时，调试器还将在评估指令时打印出堆栈数据。可以将此命令与数字参数一起使用，以多次步进。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (p) 打印指令（print instruction）</h2>
<div>
此命令打印当前指令和堆栈数据，但不会跳到下一条指令。 当我们使用上面调试命令导航到一个交易语句时，希望查看当前指令和堆栈数据时，就可以使用此命令。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (h) print this help</h2>
<div>
打印可用调试命令列表。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (q) 退出</h2>
<div>
退出调试器。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (r) 重置（reset）</h2>
<div>
将调试器重置为交易的开头。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (b) 设置断点（set a breakpoint）</h2>
<div>
此命令允许我们为任何源文件中的任何行设置断点（请参阅下面的添加和移除断点示例 ）。 命令后面可以接一个行号、或相对（当前）行号、 或者可以简单地在当前所在行添加断点。不需要加载交易来设置断点，但在这种情况下，必须指定要将其设置的源文件。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (B) 移除断点（大写的B）</h2>
<div>
此命令允许我们删除任何现有断点，方法和添加断点一样（请参阅下面的添加和移除断点示例 ）。 键入 <b>B all</b> 删除所有断点。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (c) 跳到下一个断点</h2>
<div>
此命令将代码继续执行，直到到达下一个断点或执行到最后一行。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (+) 添加一个监视表达式</h2>
<div>
使用 +:<expression> 添加一个监视表达式，这样在每次执行的时候，都可以看到监视表达式的值。<br />
译者注：比如在链上记事本, 我们要调试 addNote(string memory note) 函数, 就可以使用 +:note:
</div>
<pre style="background-color:darkblue;color:cadetblue;padding:.625em 1em;margin-top:.325em;font-size:.825em;">
debug(development:0xd2acb9c3...)> +:note
</pre>

<h2>&#x02713; (-) 移除监视表达式</h2>
<div>
使用 -:<expression> 删除监视表达式
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (?) 列出所有的监视表达式及断点</h2>
<div>
此命令将显示所有当前监视表达式的列表及断点。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (v) 显示变量</h2>
<div>
此命令将显示当前变量及其值。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (T) 卸载交易</h2>
<div>
此命令卸载当前交易，以便可以加载新交易。
</div>

<h2>&#x02713; (t) 加载交易</h2>
<div>
此命令加载新交易（给定交易哈希）。请注意，如果您已经加载了交易，则必须首先显式卸载它，然后才能加载新交易。
</div>
